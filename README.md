    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# take2d

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Take elements from a two-dimensional nested array.



<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
take2d = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-take2d@v0.2.3-umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var take2d = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/array-base-take2d/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-take2d@v0.2.3-umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.take2d;
})();
</script>
```

#### take2d( x, indices, dimension, mode )

Takes elements along a specified `dimension` from a two-dimensional nested array according to a specified [index `mode`][@stdlib/ndarray/index-modes].

```javascript
var x = [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ];
var indices = [ 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1 ];

var y = take2d( x, indices, 1, 'normalize' );
// returns [ [ 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2 ], [ 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4 ] ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **x**: input nested array.
-   **indices**: list of indices.
-   **dimension**: dimension along which to take elements. If provided a negative integer, the dimension is resolved relative to the last dimension, with the last dimension being `-1`.
-   **mode**: [index mode][@stdlib/ndarray/index-modes] specifying how to handle an index which is out-of-bounds.

If `indices` is an empty array, the function returns empty arrays along the specified `dimension`.

```javascript
var x = [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ];

var y = take2d( x, [], 1, 'throw' );
// returns [ [], [] ]

var z = take2d( x, [], 0, 'throw' );
// returns []
```

## Notes

-   The function does **not** deep copy nested array elements.
